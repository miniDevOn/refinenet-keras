# RefineNet: a Keras implementation

Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06612

This implementation is based on [GeorgeSeif's Semantic Segmentation Suite in TensorFlow](https://github.com/GeorgeSeif/Semantic-Segmentation-Suite).
The ResNet-101 frontend model is based on (flyyufelix's implementation)[https://gist.github.com/flyyufelix/65018873f8cb2bbe95f429c474aa1294].
Additional bits of code were borrowed from [zhixuhao's UNet implementation](https://github.com/zhixuhao/unet) and [aurora95's Keras-FCN](https://github.com/aurora95/Keras-FCN).
